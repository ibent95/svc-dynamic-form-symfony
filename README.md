# svc-dynamic-form-symfony
This server-side project is an implementation of dynamic forms service using [Symfony](https://symfony.com) and was generated with [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) version 5 and now it is upgraded to version 6.

## Development purpose

<p>This project was created to implement what I found and learned in my previous work at a university in Indonesia. It is something about a database for all lecturer to save their work like publications, research, teaching, and more. The purpose is to make a form that can fill all needed and can rapidly change when necessary, whenever the developer or administrator wants, just make changes in the database and the form can be used immediately. So no more deployment stage is run with this configuration.</p>
<p>Also, this is my project to learn and implement more features, libraries, codes, or logic in PHP/Symfony.</p>

## Features

1. Publications form metadata (recursively data with Forms Version).
